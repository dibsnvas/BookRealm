## About this Project
BookRealm is a website that provides users with the opportunity to discover, read, rate, and review books. It leverages the Google Books API to access a vast collection of books, offering real-time information on new releases and popular titles. The website is designed to facilitate user engagement with books, allowing them to explore, rate, and share their thoughts through reviews.

## Features
Book Discovery: Users can search for books by title, author, genre, or keyword, enabling them to discover new titles and explore different genres.
Book Details: Detailed information about each book, including title, author, publisher, publication date, description, and cover image, is provided to users.
User Reviews and Ratings: Users can write reviews for books they have read and rate them based on their experience. This feature fosters a community of readers who can share their opinions and recommendations.
Authentication: Secure user authentication system using Firebase Authentication, allowing users to create accounts, sign in, and manage their profiles.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
